# Cosin-Similarity
Cosine Similarity is a value that is bound by a constrained range of 0 and 1. If we get 
exactly 1 as the cosin value that means the two images are same. When it is 0 they are 
totally different with each other. When the cosin value gradually reach 1 like 0.99, 0.98, 
0.97 etc. that shows their similarities are in higher percentage.
